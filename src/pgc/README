# Pressure Gradient Calculator for Main Sequence Stars

This is a small program that was created in JavaFX (and therefore requires Java 8)
to help someone I know. Because of that, I do not understand the exact purpose of the math
involved. I was given the mathematical formulae needed and implemented it in Java
The purpose of this program is to calculate the pressure in sections of Main Sequence stars
given some initial parameters. The results can be written to a <code>.csv</code>
or a <code>.txt</code> file. 

### Usage 
You can find the source code here. If you want to run the program for whatever reason,
and use it, besides compiling it yourself, you can use the <code>.jar</code>
provided. Just launch the <code>.jar</code> by double clicking
or, if that doesn't work, open a command line at the directory in which the <code>.jar</code>
 is stored and use the <code>java -jar Pressure_Gradient_Calculator.jar</code>

### Version and Updates
To my knowledge, this works as expected, and I call this version 1.3 because I had a version 1, then 
 added a save, then a help, then I added better input checking 
 I do not expect to need to update it anymore
but if there is anything else useful I can add I would consider it <code>(use a Pull Request?)</code>
